### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I remember seeing this profile page thing on github ages ago, kind of forgot about it, got reminded about it, started a repo, promptly forgot about it again... Now, I'm actually putting something here.

I wonder if this will work...

<p style="text-align: center;">My code</p>

![rotating spiral](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notna888/notna888/main/rotate.svg)

<p style="text-align: center;">is always flawless</p>

<details class="mt-3 ml-4">
    <summary>Oh, and some subliminal messaging I guess</summary>
    isn't html in markdown neat? I think it is, just how you should think my code is amazing.
  </details>


</br>
In seriousness, this is me testing out what I can do with markdown here on github. I guess it's a bit of a sandbox?
